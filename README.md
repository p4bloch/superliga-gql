# Superliga GraphQL

GraphQL API that wraps the spreadsheet we use for La Superliga (FIFA internal tournament at [SCV](http://scvsoft.com/))

## Usage

`npm start` and go to `/graphiql` to play around. To consume it from a real client, POST to `/graphql`.

`npm run spreadsheet:update` downloads the latest version of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDsZY2MD7ZYq5xmVcebevu-ZVI4hwlTkhuyBoxAWGe8).
